### üîü You Should Have These Installed:

1. **Git**
   ‚û§ Open **Terminal** (macOS) or **PowerShell** (Windows) and type:

   ```bash
   git
   ```

   If it shows something other than ‚Äúcommand not found,‚Äù you‚Äôre good!

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
   ‚û§ Search for **Visual Studio Code** on your computer.
   If it opens, you‚Äôve got it.

3. **Python 3.12**
   ‚û§ In Terminal or PowerShell, type:

   ```bash
   python
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3
   ```

   You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`.

4. **VS Code Extensions**
   ‚û§ Open VS Code
   ‚û§ Click the **Extensions icon** on the left sidebar (looks like 4 squares)
   ‚û§ Make sure these are installed:

   * `Jupyter`
   * `Python`
   * `Serial Monitor`
   * `Pylance`

5. **Python Packages**
   ‚û§ In Terminal or PowerShell, type:

   ```bash
   pip show ipykernel
   pip show ipython
   ```

   If it shows details about the package, it‚Äôs installed.

6. **Cloned GitHub Repository**
   ‚û§ Check that the folder with the class files (from GitHub) is saved inside the **Documents** folder on your computer.

### üí° Using a Different Operating System?

If you're not using Windows or macOS (like Linux or something else), you'll need to install these tools using that system‚Äôs package manager (like `apt`, `yum`, etc.).
